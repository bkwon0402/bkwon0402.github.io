		<em> Note: The project was done in 2016 and user needs have shifted (Millennials no longer rely on Facebook as their primary news source). I’m still sharing the case study as it showcases my design thinking skills. 
</em> <br><br>
		The inspiration for this project came from user research I did for a related project: designing a Korean tech news aggregator. In talking to my friends about their online news reading habits, I learned that millennials are relying on Facebook as their primary news source i.e., they like to read articles that Facebook friends post. However, the Newsfeed is noisy and cluttered. I feel that I have to filter through my Newsfeed to find gems like article posts. So I created a product concept where users can read the articles their Facebook friends posted distraction-free. The product achieves this by 1) pulling articles posted by users’ Facebook friends 2) parsing the articles and presenting them in a clean format.

		 <div class="last-block">
                <div class="xs-container">    K-beauty is hot in America. However, as a skincare fanatic from Korea, I am under the strong impression that Americans are struggling to understand and take advantage of k-beauty. Case in point: I don’t recognize many of the brands that major US-based k-beauty e-commerce businesses sell. For example, on two sites that were featured on the likes of Vogue, Allure, and WSJ, I recognized less than 30% of the brands that they carry. My American friends were, of course, surprised at this fact. They maybe felt a bit deceived, too. To fill this knowledge gap, I designed a MVP mobile app that helps users to navigate the k-beauty world. The product achieves the goal by 1) telling users whether a given brand/product is reputable k-beauty or not 2) showcasing to users Korea’s best skincare products and brands.

		    <div class="xs-container">  <em>"I definitely struggled to understand and take advantage of the k-beauty products while I was there"  – a friend on her experience shopping for k-beauty in Korea </em> 
				<br>
				<br> 
				In talking to my American friends, I found that they want help finding legitimate k-beauty products and brands. Do Korean women actually use these products and brands? What are reputable k-beauty products and brands?
		</div>
		    </div> 
		  
		 <h1 id="design-process">The App </h1>
		    <div class="last-block"> 
		 <div class="xs-container">The app has two main functionalities: <br> 

1) search function - users search for a specific product or brand and find out whether it's reputable or not.
2) discover function - lets users discover Korea's best products and brands.

It'd be nice if users could buy products they like using our app, so I decided to list links to online and offline stores for each product.

		    </div> 
		    
		    
		    <h1 id="design-process">Design Process </h1>
		    <div class="xs-container">I started the design process by sketching wireframes on paper. In designing the UX and UI, I referred to many examples by looking at existing apps and sites like pttrns and dribbble. While sketching wireframes, I also brainstormed about copy to write on each screen.

			</div>
		    
		    
		     <div class="xs-container">
			     After I had wireframes ready on paper, I designed high-fidelity mockups. In this step, I was careful not to spend too much time on visual design. I planned to share mockups in the form of an interactive Invision prototype with potential users for feedback -- likely many things will change based on feedback, so I focused on bringing the UX to life instead.

Here are some of the high fidelity mockups I put together to create an Invision prototype.

                         Insight 1: Users want a different rating system
                    </div>
In designing the product, I had to decide what determines whether a brand or a product is reputable. I decided to have a small panel of normal Korean girls (10 or so) rate brands and products. My reasoning was that since most Korean girls are into skincare and are aware of major skincare brands and products, simply asking a small number of Korean girls would serve as an excellent measure. However, in testing with potential users, I found that they don't consider such a rating system trustworthy.
        <br>
	<br>
			  <em>  "The idea of a panel of Korean girls [10 or so] seems like a weak signal of whether a product is reputable, and would not instill much confidence in me as a consumer."</em> 
			    <br>
			    <br> 
			    I've learned that users want to rely on the opinions of a few experts e.g. established Korean beauty personalities or many, many normal Korean women. While I still stand by the idea that a small panel of normal Korean women would do an excellent job, I decided not to interfere with users' mental models regarding what constitutes a credible rating system.
			    <br>
			    <br> 
	<div class="last-block"> 
So instead of employing a small panel, I decided to aggregate reviews from Korea’s major cosmetics review sites and refer to external resources such as beauty awards to give ratings. In addition, a team of k-beauty experts e.g. beauty editors at major beauty magazines will help pick out best brands.

			     </div> 
			         After talking to users, I’ve learned that they want to know more than whether a brand or a product is reputable. Users want customized recommendations. For example, “Road Shop” brands are popular in Korea, but they target younger demographics i.e. teenagers and girls in their early 20s. So “Road Shop” products are still reputable, but girls in their late 20s would not want those products recommended to them.
			     <br>
			     <br> 
			         In addition, I’ve learned that users want recommendations to reflect their own needs (e.g. dry skin, acne, wrinkles). This makes sense because skincare is about catering to your own skin concerns.
			     <br>
			     <br> 
			         Based on the insights, I iterated so that the app gives more customized recommendations.
			       <br>
			     <br> 
    In the new design, when users search for a product/brand, the app gives more detailed reviews so that users can find out whether the product/brand suits their own needs.

			Insight 3: Users want help understanding k-beauty

			      <em>I was not used to "serum" or "skin milk" and had no idea how to use those” -- a friend on her experience shopping for k-beauty</em>	     
		
		    Some users wanted a short k-beauty guide in a section somewhere. For example, a friend commented that she had no idea how to use “serum” or “skin milk” since she was not used to the terms and would appreciate help understanding the terms.
		    <br>
		    <br>
		    I was initially hesitant to include an “K-beauty Cheat Sheet” -- I wanted the app to be simple and just serve the core functions.
		       <br>
		    <br>
		    However, after talking to more potential users, I decided to include the cheat sheet because it has a lot benefit to users, most of whom are not yet familiar with k-beauty. While users can also research the terms elsewhere, the Cheat Sheet allows users to better understand products without leaving the app.

		    <br> 
		    <em>“I like the cheat sheet since it is an emerging market and all of the different terms are overwhelming.”</em>
