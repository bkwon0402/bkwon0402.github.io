# The Project

<div class="small_container">
I worked with the product team at Avail Medsystems to help create their first digital help center. Avail is a healthtech startup offering a software and hardware system that allows medical professionals to collaborate real-time. The help center (eIFU) was to be an electronic version of IFU (Instructions for Use), which lays out detailed, step-by-step instructions for using medical products.

# The Challenge

<div class="small_container">
As I started working on the project, I encountered two challenges.
	<br>
	<br>
The biggest challenge was to design with technical constraints. When I joined the project, the company had already chosen a CMS platform. The platform’s designs, however, didn’t provide an optimal user experience. The company’s engineering team wasn’t available for this project, and without their support I was challenged to think creatively as to how to design an excellent user experience given the constraints. 
	<br>
	<br>
In addition, the 100-page IFU on which the eIFU was to be based wasn’t well-written. The topics weren’t well-organized and the content needed refinement. Avail’s product operates in a very complex ecosystem — there are multiple user groups and subgroups and each group has access to different features and devices. To create an excellent user experience for different parties, I was challenged to completely rethink how to present content.

# Understanding the Opportunity 

<div class="small_container">
With these challenges in mind, I started reviewing information on the product and it soon became clear to me that the eIFU has the potential to serve pressing yet unmet user needs. When I asked the team about the UX issues with the current product, I learned that the team is getting a large volume of inquiries from frustrated users who were confused about the UX. A medical company like Avail can’t immediately update designs due to regulations, and I noted that the eIFU can not only serve as an electronic version of the IFU but also help resolve the usability issues that users are encountering until UX designs are updated. 
	<br>
	<br>
Armed with this insight, I set out to first reorganize content and, second, develop wireframes. In reorganizing content, I started by writing down the list of content each user group needs and the list of questions each group is likely to have, and then refined the lists with the PM. At the same time, I started conducting a thorough review of the IFU content and asked clarifying questions to develop a nuanced understanding of the content.

<br> 

<div class="small_container">
Finally, I developed wireframes, which we iterated multiple times per user feedback.

# Designing with Technical Constraints 

<div class="small_container">
Noting that we couldn’t make any structural changes since the engineering team was unavailable, I made use of CSS rewriting to revamp designs. For example, the platform presents selections of topics in the following way: 
</div> 

<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail2.png">
	<br> 
</div>
<br>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
How the platform presents selections 
   </p> </div>
<br> 

<div class="small_container">
However, users aren’t familiar with navigating through content in this way —  a single column list of text links — as buttons aren’t commonplace and further, users aren’t used to using the “Prev” and “Next” buttons on the bottom to navigate through topics. While I felt that the default designs could potentially work if we present multiple groups of topics on the same page like some other help centers do (see the example below), the platform didn’t allow presenting multiple groups of topics, so I had to think of other ways to make things work.

</div>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">

   </p> </div>
<br> 


<div class="small_container">
To revamp the designs, I rewrote CSS to create designs that present selections in a way that’s familiar to users. Here’s the prototype I shared with the team:
