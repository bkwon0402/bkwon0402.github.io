<div class="small_container">
I worked with the product team at Avail Medsystems to help create their first digital help center. Avail is a healthtech startup offering a software and hardware system that allows medical professionals to collaborate real-time. The help center (eIFU) was to be an electronic version of IFU (Instructions for Use), which lays out detailed, step-by-step instructions for using medical products.  
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h1> The Challenge </h1>

<div class="small_container">
As I started working on the project, I encountered two challenges.
	<br />
	<br />
The biggest challenge was to design with technical constraints. When I joined the project, the company had already chosen a CMS platform. The platform’s designs, however, didn’t provide an optimal user experience. The company’s engineering team wasn’t available for this project, and without their support I was challenged to think creatively as to how to design an excellent user experience given the constraints. 
	<br />
	<br />
In addition, the 100-page IFU on which the eIFU was to be based wasn’t well-written. The topics weren’t well-organized and the content needed refinement. Avail’s product operates in a very complex ecosystem — there are multiple user groups and subgroups and each group has access to different features and devices. To create an excellent user experience for different parties, I was challenged to completely rethink how to present content. 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<h1> Understanding the Opportunity </h1>

<div class="small_container">
With these challenges in mind, I started reviewing information on the product and it soon became clear to me that the eIFU has the potential to serve pressing yet unmet user needs. When I asked the team about the UX issues with the current product, I learned that the team is getting a large volume of inquiries from frustrated users who were confused about the UX. A medical company like Avail can’t immediately update designs due to regulations, and I noted that the eIFU can not only serve as an electronic version of the IFU but also help resolve the usability issues that users are encountering until UX designs are updated. 
	<br />
	<br />
Armed with this insight, I set out to first reorganize content and, second, develop wireframes. In reorganizing content, I started by writing down the list of content each user group needs and the list of questions each group is likely to have, and then refined the lists with the PM. At the same time, I started conducting a thorough review of the IFU content and asked clarifying questions to develop a nuanced understanding of the content. 	
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="text_center">

	<br /> 
</div>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
Content and questions lists that I refined with the PM 
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
Finally, I developed wireframes, which we iterated multiple times per user feedback.  
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h1> Designing with Technical Constraints </h1>

<div class="small_container">
Noting that we couldn’t make any structural changes since the engineering team was unavailable, I made use of CSS rewriting to revamp designs. For example, the platform presents selections of topics in the following way: 
</div>

<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail2.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
How the platform presents selections 
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
However, users aren’t familiar with navigating through content in this way —  a single column list of text links — as buttons aren’t commonplace and further, users aren’t used to using the “Prev” and “Next” buttons on the bottom to navigate through topics. While I felt that the default designs could potentially work if we present multiple groups of topics on the same page like some other help centers do (see the example below), the platform didn’t allow presenting multiple groups of topics, so I had to think of other ways to make things work.  
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail3.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
Airbnb’s help center presents multiple groups of topics 
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
To revamp the designs, I rewrote CSS to create designs that present selections in a way that’s familiar to users. Here’s the prototype I shared with the team: 
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail4.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
The new designs convert the list of text links into buttons and remove unnecessary elements such as the “In this section” header and the “Prev” and “Next” buttons. Here’s the final design for the page, in which I added visual elements like icons and colors to create a more cohesive experience for users:
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail5.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
Additionally, I used CSS rewriting and the platform’s various features to create custom design elements. For example, while the platform didn’t allow creating labels, I created a workaround using the platform’s other features (specifically, creating a class then assigning attributes to the class) to create the console machine labels. 
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail6.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
	The custom-created <em>Gen 1.5 Only</em> label 
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
We found that it’s sometimes necessary to indicate the console type, since there are multiple types, and the custom-created labels effectively communicate critical information. 
	<br />
	<br /> 
	In another example, I custom created summary sections. Some pages contain complex information, and it is necessary for users to be able to jump to sub-sections within the page via a summary section. While the platform didn’t allow creating such sections, I put together an element that looks and functions like one using the platform’s various features. Here’s the prototype I shared with the team:  
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail7.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
The custom-created summary section enables users to easily navigate content  
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<h1> Iterations </h1>
<div class="small_container">
We learned useful insights from sharing prototypes with users. 
<br />
<br /> 
First, while we initially planned to include content in the eIFU for Avail's engineers to use when providing technical help, too, we learned it’s better not to since Avail positions itself as a white-glove service provider and it’s best to take care of internal needs in a non client-facing place. 
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail8.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
Original eIFU homepage, with a link for internal use by Avail’s engineers  
   </p> </div>
<p><br /> 
<br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail9.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
Final live eIFU homepage, where I deleted content for engineers (in addition, I edited CSS to apply Avail’s brand style and designed custom icons and the cover photo)  
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
Second, we gathered useful feedback on the tone. Folks found the “I want help with…” tone (vs. simply stating the task) to be friendly and helpful, so we went with that tone.   
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail10.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
	<strong>Left</strong>: buttons have “I want help with…” tone <strong>Right</strong>: buttons state tasks 
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>

<div class="small_container">
Third, we learned valuable insights on whether to use gridview vs. listview in presenting selections.  
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/avail11.png" />
	<br /> 
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">
	<strong>Left</strong>: Listview prototype <strong>Right</strong>: Gridview prototype 
   </p> </div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="small_container">
I initially leaned towards listview, possibly because I happened to just have reviewed a product that nicely uses listview. However, I soon learned that folks prefer gridview — they thought it looked nicer visually and liked not having to scroll down to review selections. UX research uncovers that listview works better when users are in search mode (and rely primarily on reading the text to make selections) and gridview works better when in browse mode (and rely on images to make selections). While our users are in search mode, I felt that user testers made a valid point — listview, in our case, forces users to scroll down to view selections and we went with gridview. 
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<h1>What I’ve learned </h1>

<div class="small_container">
First, I learned the usefulness of technical skills, which I wasn’t aware would be necessary on this project, going in. However, my familiarity with basic front-end programming turned out to be an asset in making the project a success. In a resource-strapped startup environment, unexpected situations like this can arise anytime, and I’m excited to further hone my technical skills. 
	<br /> 
Second, the project confirmed the importance of having humility. As my initial preference for listview was quickly proved to be faulty, I often learn from users and the clients, who have spent more time studying the problem we're solving. So far, I've enjoyed being challenged and I'm looking forward to future opportunities to learn from others.
