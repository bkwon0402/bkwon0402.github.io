                    Once I shared UX feedback on the web wireframes, I started prototyping mobile designs. It was
                    important that the product be mobile-friendly since users will often be using the product on mobile
                    while doing fieldwork, so crafting solutions for mobile then adapting the designs to the web made
                    sense.

                            In designing the mobile product, I kept in mind that users often depend on the mobile
                            product to keep track of their own assigned work while in the field. Hence, the designs
                            immediately present today’s to-do list once users open the app — and the list is organized
                            in the order of priority so it’s extremely easy to review workflow, and users can easily
                            update information on cards.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            This makes sense because users often depend on the mobile product to keep track of assigned
                            work while in the field.

                            including dispatch officers who assign work, will want to review workflow at the
                            organization level. The web product features All Activities & Cases tab promintently to full
                            such organizational needs.

                            stage. While we hadn’t worked on screens other than the homepage, I put together a clickable
                            prototype that linked the homepage to rough prototypes of other key pages so that we could
                            test whether users are able to accurately take intended actions. It’s better to fail early
                            and course- correct than wait until you have full designs ready, so I felt that it was the
                            right call to test additional features at that point.

                        Prototyping and building on others’ ideas allowed me to create more creative solutions. For
                        example, the PM liked the idea of putting the status info on top right of the card because of
                        easy discoverability. I liked this direction too, and started exploring visualizing info so that
                        it becomes even easier for users to register status information at a glance.

                    <div class="small_container">


                        When I joined the project, the PM provided key information on the product as well as web
                        wireframes for some of the key pages. After reviewing the information, I asked clarifying
                        questions then started thinking through the UX in the wireframes.
                        <br/>

                    # User-Centered Design

                    <div class="small_container">
                        I quickly noted that the wireframes don’t meet critical user needs and that it’s important that
                        we improve the UX if the product were to be successful. Here are some of the UX critiques and
                        recommendations I provided.
                        <br/>

                    <div class="small_container">
                        First, the product falls short of meeting the expectations of enabling users (i.e officers
                        resolving animal-related incidents in the community) to efficiently track their work because
                        users can’t easily update information on cards. Currently, users need to click on the more
                        button located on the top right of the card to access the list of actions they can take.
                    </div>


                    <br/>

                    <div class="text_center">

                    <div class="small_container">
                        Second, users couldn’t efficiently review their assigned work because the tab menu separates
                        Activities and Cases. From an officer’s point of view, it’s not so important whether an incident
                        is classified as an Activity or a Case (this distinction exists for legal purposes). What
                        matters to them is that they can quickly review their work, so merging the Activities and Cases
                        tabs makes sense.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Third, the <em> Assigned to </em> filter on top right complicates workflow for an individual
                        officer since they need to go through the extra step of clicking their name to start reviewing
                        assigned work. Further, the organization as a whole needs to be able to easily review workflow
                        for all officers, so I felt it was necessary that we revamp the designs to cater to the needs of
                        both individual users’ and the organization.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Lastly, users couldn’t easily understand <em>Priority Level</em>, a piece of information that
                        user research showed us to be critical to users. In the original design, <em>Priority Level</em>
                        consisted of the vertical color strip on the left side of the card and text info (e.g. Priority:
                        1) on the card.
                    </div>

                    <br/>

                    <div class="small_container">
                        However, it makes more sense to merge the color strip and the text info; otherwise, users might
                        not remember which level each color indicates (and there are 10 different priority levels) or
                        they might miss the text info.
                        <br/>


                        The team was excited to receive my feedback. Here is the final high-fidelity mockup of the same
                        page.

                        whole can easily review workflow thanks to the <em>My Activities &amp; Cases</em> and <em>All
                        Activities &amp; Cases</em> tab menus, and <em>Priority Level </em>information stands out.

                    <div class="small_container">
                        Arriving at the final high-fidelity mockups took close collaboration with the team, which I
                        achieved in the following ways:
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        First, once I shared UX feedback on the web wireframes, I started prototyping mobile designs. It
                        was extremely important that the product be mobile-friendly, since users will often be using the
                        product on mobile while doing fieldwork, so crafting solutions for mobile then adapting the
                        designs to the web made complete sense.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Second, I and I and the PM started building each other’s ideas, which pushed us to create more
                        creative solutions. For example, the PM liked the idea of putting the status information on top
                        right of the card because easy discoverability will help users readily understand status. I
                        liked this direction too, and started exploring visualizing information so that it becomes even
                        easier for users to register status information at a glance.
                    </div>

                    <div class="text_center">
                        <img src="/images/sl5.png" width="800"/>
                        <br/>

                    <br/>

                    <div class="small_container">
                        After prototyping, I eventually came up with mini progress bar icons that fit right in with the
                        other icons used in the web product.

                    <div class="small_container">
                        These icons were not only received well by the users but also straightforward to implement from
                        a technical standpoint. Furthermore, they help create a coherent user experience because they go
                        well with the other icons used in the web cards.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Third, I tested prototypes with users to validate and iterate design decisions and clear any
                        doubts we had. For example, we liked the idea of keeping things simple by not using column
                        headers on cards.

                    <div class="small_container">
                        However, noting that our hunches could be proved wrong (in fact, I thought not using labels for
                        status on top right might leave users confused), we tested prototypes with users. During this
                        process, I took the initiative to test other things that we can test at this stage. For example,
                        while we hadn’t worked on screens other than the homepage, I put together a clickable prototype
                        that linked the homepage to rough prototypes of other key pages so that we could test whether
                        users are able to accurately take intended actions on cards while on the homepage. It’s better
                        to fail early and course- correct than wait until you have full designs ready, so I felt that it
                        was the right call to test additional features at that point.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        We were excited to find, based on these user tests, that folks had no problem taking actions on
                        cards and that the information on cards all made sense to them even without the labels.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In other rounds of testing, we iterated based on feedback. For example, we found that filters on
                        the web had a usability issue and we moved the checkboxes to the left of selections so that it’s

                        Fourth, I carefully considered how user needs might shift depending on user choice of device.
                        For example, in designing the mobile product, I kept in mind that users often depend on the
                        mobile product to keep track of their own assigned work while in the field. Hence, the designs
                        immediately present today’s to-do list once users open the app — and the list is organized in
                        the order of priority so it’s extremely easy to review workflow, and users can easily update
                        information on cards.

                    <div class="small_container">
                        In designing the web product, on the other hand, I kept in mind that users are likely to have
                        different needs. While an individual officer may well want to review their workflow on the web,
                        it’s also likely that the organization as a whole, including dispatch officers who assign work,
                        will use the web interface to review workflow at the organization level. Keeping organizational
                        needs in mind, I designed the web product so that users have easier access to All Activities
                        &amp; Cases. In the mobile product, All Activities &amp; Cases is in the hamburger menu and made
                        less prominent, though still accessible.

                        had usability issues.

                        I’d reduce whitespace on cards on mobile, particularly in the middle section where the address
                        and assigned officer information are found. This way, users could review more cards/info as they
                        scroll down. I’d also reconsider how we did icon designs on mobile cards. While we liked the
                        idea of keeping things simple and not using icons on mobile cards, we kept the person icon for
                        the assigned officer info since we thought that might help people more easily digest information
                        as a whole. However, I’d explore other ways to represent information so that information flows a
                        bit better.
