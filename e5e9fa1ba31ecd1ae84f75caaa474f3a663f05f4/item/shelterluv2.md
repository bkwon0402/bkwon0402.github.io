# The Challenge

<div class="small_container">
	I designed the web and mobile UX/UI for a product that allows government-based animal shelters to track animal-related law enforcement work they did in the community. The key design challenge was to make things mobile-friendlyâ€”the product is intended to help officers work more efficiently while doing fieldwork, so it was extremely important that the mobile product help them achieve their goals easily and efficiently. Tackling this design challenge started with developing a deep empathy with the people I was designing for. Based on the insights I gained, I prototyped ideas and eventually arrived at final solutions that catered to their needs.
