# The Challenge

<div class="small_container">

I worked with the PM at Shelterluv to help design the Field Services product, a new product initiative that allows government-based animal shelters to track animal-related law enforcement work they do in the community.  

</div>	 

<br>

<div class="small_container">

<h1> The Process </h1> 

When I joined the project, the PM provided key information on the product as well as web wireframes for some of the key pages. After reviewing the information, I asked clarifying questions then started thinking through the UX in the wireframes.  

</div> 
<br> 

<div class="small_container">

<h1> User-Centered Design </h1> 

I quickly noted that the wireframes don’t meet critical user needs and that it’s important that we improve the UX if the product were to be successful. Here are some of the UX critiques and recommendations I provided. 
</div> 

<br> 

<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/sl1.png" width="800" >
	<br> 
</div>
<br> 
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">Homepage wireframe that I was provided with</p> </div>
<br> 



<div class="small_container">
First, the product falls short of meeting the expectations of enabling users (i.e officers resolving animal-related incidents in the community) to efficiently track their work because users can’t easily update information on cards. Currently, users need to click on the more button located on the top right of the card to access the list of actions they can take. 
</div> 


<br> 

<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/sl2.png" width="300" >
	<br> 
</div>
<br> 
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">The <em> more </em> button on top right  </p> </div>
<br> 


<div class="small_container">
Second, users couldn’t efficiently review their assigned work because the tab menu separates Activities and Cases. From an officer’s point of view, it’s not so important whether an incident is classified as an Activity or a Case (this distinction exists for legal purposes). What matters to them is that they can quickly review their work, so merging the Activities and Cases tabs makes sense.  
<br> 
<br>	
	Third, the <em> Assigned to </em> filter on top right complicates workflow for an individual officer since they need to go through the extra step of clicking their name to start reviewing assigned work. Further, the organization as a whole needs to be able to easily review workflow for all officers, so I felt it was necessary that we revamp the designs to cater to the needs of both individual users’ and the organization.  
<br> 
<br>
	Lastly, users couldn’t easily understand <em>Priority Level</em>, a piece of information that user research showed us to be critical to users. In the original design, <em>Priority Level</em> consisted of the vertical color strip on the left side of the card and text info (e.g. Priority: 1) on the card. 
</div> 

<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/sl3.png" width="800" >
	<br> 
</div>
<br> 
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;">Current <em>Priority Level</em> designs </p> </div>
<br> 

<div class="small_container">
However, it makes more sense to merge the color strip and the text info; otherwise, users might not remember which level each color indicates (and there are 10 different priority levels) or they might miss the text info. 
<br> 


The team was excited to receive my feedback. Here is the final high-fidelity mockup of the same page.   
</div> 
<br> 
<div class="text_center">
	<img src="/images/sl4.png" >
	<br> 
</div>

<div class="small_container">
In the final design, users are able to easily take key actions on cards (less important actions are hidden under the more icon on top right), individual users as well as the organization as a whole can easily review workflow thanks to the <em>My Activities & Cases</em> and <em>All Activities & Cases</em> tab menus, and <em>Priority Level </em>information stands out. 
</div> 
<br> 

# The Process 
<div class="small_container"> 
Arriving at the final high-fidelity mockups took close collaboration with the team, which I achieved in the following ways: 
<br> 
<br>
First, once I shared UX feedback on the web wireframes, I started prototyping mobile designs.   It was extremely important that the product be mobile-friendly, since users will often be using the product on mobile while doing fieldwork, so crafting solutions for mobile then adapting the designs to the web made complete sense.  
<br> 
<br>
Second, I and I and the PM  started building each other’s ideas, which pushed us to create more creative solutions. For example, the PM liked the idea of putting the status information on top right of the card because easy discoverability will help users readily understand status. I liked this direction too, and started exploring visualizing information so that it becomes even easier for users to register status information at a glance.

<br> 
<div class="feedlycaption"><p style="text-align: center;"> Initial prototype of how I visualized status information   </p> </div>
<br> 

<div class="small_container"> 
	After prototyping, I eventually came up with mini progress bar icons that fit right in with the other icons used in the web product.
