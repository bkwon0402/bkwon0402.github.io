# The Challenge

3D Data hired me to design branding. 3D Data XX company description.

3D Data does interesting work. I wanted their branding to reflect that, so I decided to design branding that is unique and unconventional. 

This meant that I tried to design interesting and provocative icons. In addition, in choosing a color scheme, I decided to go with purple, which I think keeps things more interesting, instead of choosing a safe option such as blue. 

I am also working on their website design, and hereâ€™s a landing page mockup I designed where you can find the branding assets.
