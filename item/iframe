# The Challenge

<div class="small_container">
	I redesigned the mobile and web UX/UI of an iframe product that animals shelters use to display adoptable animals on their websites. While a shelter’s website is a crucial channel for getting adoptable animals in front of adopters, existing products fell short of providing superb user experience. Determined to change the status quo, I set out to redesign the product.

	Once users log in, they have immediate access to their own to-do list arranged in order of priority. By making the to-do list front and center, I’ve enabled the product to become a true part of and enhance user workflow. In addition, based on the insight that an item’s priority and status information are crucial pieces of information that determine whether/when users work on that item, I’ve made those pieces of information visually prominent (i.e., clear, large labels for priority information and a custom mini-progress bar for status information) so that users can easily scan the list for the information. 
re more mini-infographics I designed.
