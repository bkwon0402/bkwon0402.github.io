# The Challenge

YTF hired me as their Chief Storytelling Officer to craft visual narratives around the organization and programs. In that capacity, I was given complete autonomy and worked with minimal supervision.

# The Process

I would not have been able to distill YTF's story unless I fully understood the complexities of it. Accordingly, I invested time into truly understanding the organization and its work.  

This meant talking to the founder and CEO as well as field staff, interviewing beneficiaries, analyzing relevant program documents, and closely reading content on their site.   

In addition, I carried out extensive research to understand the problems that the organization is addressing. This meant finding and reading research papers, white papers, and blog posts. 

After I completed my research, I designed visuals that explained the problems and programs. Designing visuals consisted of three steps: 1) deciding what we wanted to say 2) deciding how we wanted to say it 3) working on visual design.   

Part of a designerâ€™s job is to become a storyteller and an editor. In that sense, my experience as a storyteller at YTF has been immensely helpful in helping me grow as a designer.

# Infographics

Prominent non-profit organizations such as Girl Effect, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Ashoka, Schwab Foundation, and Cherie Blaire Foundation picked up and re-tweeted content I created.      

Here are the infographics that Girl Effect retweeted.

Here are more mini-infographics I designed.

Here is an infographic I designed on why the organization invests in women. I owned the whole design process from content development to visual design.

I also designed visually appealing content to share on social media.
