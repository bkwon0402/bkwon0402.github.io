# The Challenge

<div class="small_container">
	I designed the web and mobile UX/UI for a product that allows government-based animal shelters to track animal-related law enforcement work they did in the community. The key design challenge was to make things mobile-friendly—the product is intended to help officers work more efficiently while doing fieldwork, so it was extremely important that the mobile product help them achieve their goals easily and efficiently. Tackling this design challenge started with developing a deep empathy with the people I was designing for. Based on the insights I gained, I prototyped ideas and eventually arrived at final solutions that catered to their needs.

<h1> User Needs </h1> 

	Research has revealed that no existing software solution truly fulfilled target users’ needs. Among other things, users were frustrated that products were often inaccessible in the field and that it was difficult to view their own assigned items and track them. To create a groundbreaking product, I developed a full understanding of users’ goals and pain points. Key insights were: 

1)  Users need real-time and easy access for viewing, editing, and creating new activities/cases.
2)  Certain information (such as priority level) is critical and needs to be easily accessible.

	Once users log in, they have immediate access to their own to-do list arranged in order of priority. By making the to-do list front and center, I’ve enabled the product to become a true part of and enhance user workflow. In addition, based on the insight that an item’s priority and status information are crucial pieces of information that determine whether/when users work on that item, I’ve made those pieces of information visually prominent (i.e., clear, large labels for priority information and a custom mini-progress bar for status information) so that users can easily scan the list for the information.

<div class="small_container">
	The four wings consist of:  
	<br> 

Wing 1: Focus - identify a single, concrete, measurable goal <br>
Wing 2: Grab - make someone look <br>
Wing 3: Engage - foster personal connection <br>
Wing 4: Take Action - enable and empower others 
<br>

My job was to infuse psychological research into the four wings. This consisted of three steps. 
First, I read relevant articles in behavioral science - mainly in social psychology and behavioral economics, some in cognitive psychology and management science. Second, I extracted relevant psychological insights from the articles that support the ideas presented in Wing 1-4. Lastly, I came up with copy that explains how the insights support the ideas, and added the copy to the draft of the book where it is relevant.     

For example, in Wing 4: Take Action, I shared a relevant psychological study to introduce the idea that making the first target behavior easily empowers users and supporters to take further action. Similarly, in Wing 3: Engage, I explained how telling a story engages users from a psychological perspective -- humans have an appetite for stories, which reflects the basic human need to understand patterns of life.

# Takeaway 
 
<div class="small_container">

	A designer’s job is not just to make things pretty, but to make things work better. The idea that designers can borrow insights from psychology to design better products and services was eye-opening. The research assistantship helped me build a strong foundation in social psychology and behavioral economics, which helps me understand what makes users tick at a deeper level.
