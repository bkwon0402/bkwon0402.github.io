# The Challenge

I worked with WeFinance founders to design branding. WeFinance is a crowdlending platform for student loans and other low-risk debt utilizing borrowers’ personal networks and real identities.

# Logo Design 

I started the project by researching logos. I went on sites such as Dribbble and Pinterest and looked for inspiration. I quite liked logos that had a combination of an interesting shape and text i.e. company name. The founders were happy with the direction, and I came up with two options:  

1) a heart shape - WeFinance is about happiness and helping each other, and a heart embodies the spirit of the company.

Here are the sketches/early prototype I shared.

<div class="logo2"></div>
<br>
2) a circle shape --  think “circle of connections”; a circle represents the idea that WeFinance connects people. 

Here’s the prototype I shared. 

<div class="logo3"></div>


We ultimately decided to go with option 2) a circle. While WeFinance is about happiness, we realized a heart tends to conjure up ideas of romantic relationships and dating. On the other hand, the sophisticated feel of option 2) keeps things more professional, which better matches the personality of the financial services company.  

Once we decided on option 2), I designed new gradients and experimented further.

Here are some of the new ideas I tried.

<br>
<div class="logo7"></div>
<br>
<div class="logo8"></div>
<br>
<div class="logo9"></div>
<br>

We liked the original idea the most, so decided to refine the concept.

After varying fonts, character spacing, and colors, we found the right combination.

<div class="logo12"></div>
<br>
We also looked into integrating the logo into the name more. Based on the insight of one of the founders, we tried emphasizing ‘We’ specifically in their name via the logo.  
<div class="logo13"></div>
<br>
<div class="logo14"></div>
<br>
<div class="logo15"></div>
<br>
And we loved the circle around the WE option. The logo is interesting and unique. In addition, it embodies the business model that connects people.    

And here is the final logo:

<div class="logo17"></div>

I was new to logo design, but am happy with how things went. I designed the logo in just six days and received a lot of positive feedback from the team.

# Icon Design  

I also designed icons the company used on the website.
