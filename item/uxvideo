# The Challenge

While at Stanford, I had the privilege of working closely with General Atlantic Professor of Marketing Jennifer Aaker at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I provided research assistance to the writing of her book The Dragonfly Effect: Quick, Effective, Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Make a Difference. As her research assistant, I was tasked with researching how you can tap psychological insights to design innovative products and helped to develop the theoretical framework of the book.
