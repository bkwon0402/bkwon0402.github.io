# The Challenge

<div class="small_container">
    K-beauty is hot in America. However, as a skincare fanatic from Korea, I am under the strong impression that Americans are struggling to understand and take advantage of k-beauty. Case in point: I don’t recognize many of the brands that major US-based k-beauty e-commerce businesses sell. For example, on two sites that were featured on the likes of Vogue, Allure, and WSJ, I recognized less than 30% of the brands that they carry. My American friends were, of course, surprised at this fact. They maybe felt a bit deceived, too. To fill this knowledge gap, I designed a concept mobile app that helps users to navigate the k-beauty world. The product achieves the goal by 1) telling users whether a given brand/product is reputable k-beauty or not 2) showcasing to users Korea’s best skincare products and brands.
