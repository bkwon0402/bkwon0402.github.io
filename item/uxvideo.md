# The Challenge

As an intern at Cooper, I collaborated with designers to create The Drawing Board: Smart Checks that presents a concept of an iPad app that redesigns the check splitting experience.

I drew the graphics used in the video and contributed to refining the product concept.  

At Cooper, I also completed Cooper U Interaction Design Practicum, an intensive UX training program.
